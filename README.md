# hexed
(WIP) A hexagonal keyboard layout based on noted/neo
![hexed layout overview](hexed2.png?raw=true)
## Features
- Hexagonal keys with angled home row keys (S I E, T N R)
- Stepped rows for better haptics (less fat-fingering on a smaller footprint)
- Based on [noted](https://dariogoetz.github.io/noted-layout/) which is optimized on 60% German and 40% English texts
- Layers for numbers/math symbols, function keys and greek letters (num, nav, üèõÔ∏è) and toggle (‚ÆÅ) instead of capslock
- 3D-printable case and key caps (with a blob of epoxy resin)
- Generated with a FreeCAD macro and a spreadsheet for fast iterations
- Designed for Kailh Choc v1 switches
